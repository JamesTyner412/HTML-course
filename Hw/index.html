                <p class="txt">My name is james Tyner im 20 years old. Im currently enrolled
                    in college. my plan is to become a game developer. since i was a child i always had a creative
                    Imagination or so that what Iv been told by my family. since then I wanted to create a video game and 
                    share my ideas to the world. I love playing video games and been playing basiclly my whole 
                    life. I dont know all the video games in the world but i feel like it time to break that shell
                    and learn more about video games. so I decided to become a video game developer. with this i can finally acomplish 
                    my dream goal.
